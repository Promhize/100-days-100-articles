The goal of this article is to achieve a font-size value that fluidly transitions from `14px` at a browser window width of `769px`, to `24px` for a `2048px` browser window width.

First off, letâ€™s get the definition of a responsive DOM element out of the way. Responsive elements should respond to changes in viewport size, i.e when I reduce or increase the size of my browser window, a responsive DOM element should respond in some predefined way.

With CSS3 media queries, we are able to respond to screen resizes within CSS. Most of the time, these are breakpoints at `480px`, `768px`, and `769px`. These are suitable for most web applications, but what if we could go further than just 3,4,5 break points? What if we could respond to every 1px browser resize all the way from over `2048px` to `1px`. That means we can create CSS declarations that respond to me reducing my browser window from `2048px` to `2047px`, responding to every `1px` change all the way down to `0px`.


Thanks to the CSS3 `calc` function, and viewport units (vh, vw), we can achieve this functionality.

>The calc function lets you perform calculation when specifying CSS property values

>Viewport units are represented as percentages of the visible area of a web page. That is the entire browser window, minus the address bar, scroll bar, tabs, etc.

Luckily both calc and viewport units have browser support all the way back to IE9.


```
html {
  font-size: 1vh;
}
```

In the code snippet above, if the browser width minus scrollbar is `1800px`, font-size will be `18px`, thatâ€™s 1% of 1800. Thatâ€™s okay, but on a `800px` screen, font-size will be `8px` ðŸ˜®. Thatâ€™s not what we want.

Thanks to some clever calculations possible with the `calc` function we can overcome this problem.

If you have written Javascript or some proper programming language, thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™d have come across the mathematical expression below, if you have not, Iâ€™ve tried to explain it below.

```
(Math.random() * (769 - 2048) + 769)
```
This is a Javascript snippet and what it does is generate a random number within the range of 769 and 2048. `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 to 0.9999999999999999. We get that number and multiply it by the difference between 2048 and 769, which is 1279. This ensures `random number*1279+769`, always return a value between 769 and 2048. You can try it out yourself, `0*1279+769` is 769 and `0.99*1279+769` gives you 2035.21.

So we have the basis for further calculations.

In our case, we want a font-size within the range `14px` to `24px`, so our range is 10px and 14px is our base. What we want is to generate a random number between 0 and 0.999999999999, multiply it by 10 and add it to 14. So that, `0*10+14` is 14, and `0.9999*10+14` is 23.9999, but we donâ€™t have access to Javascriptâ€™s Math.random within our CSS. How do we generate the random number we need then?

Letâ€™s take a look at what we have. With the VW viewport unit, we can dynamically access the windowâ€™s width with `100vw`. So `100vw` on a `1366px` screen is `1366px`, on a `1560px` screen, itâ€™s also `1560px`, without us hard-coding the specific pixel value.

With our target minimum screen width (769px), maximum screen width (2048px) and dynamically calculated screen width (100vw), we are armed with what we need to generate a random number from 0 to 0.99999999999. By simply doing `(100vwâ€Šâ€”â€Š769px)/2048px`, we can generate any value from 0 upwards, depending on the value of 100vw. So if a users viewport width is 1800px, `(100vwâ€Šâ€”â€Š769px)/2048px` is calculated as `(1800pxâ€Šâ€”â€Š769px)/2048px` by the browser, which results in 0.50341796875. Yay, we have our random number. We can now multiply 0.50341796875 by 10 (remember our range?), which results in 5.0341796875. The final step is to add 5.0341796875 to 14px `5.0341796875`, which results in a `19.0341796875px` font-size for a user with a `1800px` viewport width.

The final formula can be written as,

```
html {
  font-size: minimumPixel + range * ((viewportWidth - minScreenWidth) / maxScreenWidth)
}

/* Example */

html {
  font-size: 14px + 10 * ((100vw - 769px) / 2048px);
}
```

So instead of serving all viewport widths between `769px` and `2048px` the same font width, usually `18px`, we can dynamically serve users a more suitable range from `14px` to `24px`.

This can be combined with media queries to achieve as much responsiveness as possible


```
/* Example */

/* Mobile and Tablet */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  html {
    font-size: 16px + 2 * ((100vw - 360px) / 768px);
  }
}

/* Laptop and Desktops screens */
@media (min-width: 769px) {
  html {
    font-size: 14px + 10 * ((100vw - 769px) / 2048px);
  }
}

/* Excessively large screens */
html {
  font-size: 36px;
}
```

This can be applied to be more than just font-size, it can be used to create paddings, margins, widths that stretch and squeeze as the viewport width increases and decreases.

I hope you enjoyed the article, hopefully you'll use this technique a lot more in your projects.
